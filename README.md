# Campus Network Design & Implementation
<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>
Multi-X University is a large university which has two campuses situated 20 miles apart. The university's students and staff are distributed in 4 faculties; these include the faculties of:
 
* Faculty of Business (FOB)
* Faculty of Law (FOL)
* Faculty of Information, Sains and Technology (FIST)
* Faculty of Engineering & Technology (FET)

Each member of staff has a PC and students have acces to PCs in the labs. The network topology for to support the Main and Sub campus.

Main campus:
* <b>Building-A</b>: Administrative staff in the departments of management, HR and finance. The admin staff PCs are distributed in the building offices and it is expected that they will share some networking equipment (VLAN). The Faculty of Business is also situated in this building.
* <b>Building-B</b>: Faculty of Engineering and Laws
* <b>Building-C</b>: Students' labs and IT department. The IT department hosts the University Web Server and other servers.
* There is alos an email server hosted externally on the <b>cloud</b>.

Sub campus:
* <b>Faculy of Cinematic Arts (FOC)</b>: Staff and student's labs are situated on separated floors.

Each department/faculty is expected to be on its own separate IP network. The switches should be configured with appropriate VLANs and security settings. RIPv2 will be used to provide routing for the routers in the internal network and static routing for the external server. The devices in building A will be expected to acquire dynamic IP addresses from a router-based DHCP server.

<h2>Technologies Implemented</h2>
<p>
1. Creating a network topology.<br>
2. Hierarchical Network Design.<br>
3. Connecting Networking devices with Correct cabling.<br>
4. Creating VLANs and assigning ports VLAN numbers.<br>
5. Subnetting and IP Addressing.<br>
6. Configuring Inter-VLAN Routing (Router on a stick).<br>
7. Configuring DHCP Server (Router as the DHCP Server).<br>
8. Configuring SSH for secure Remote access.<br>
9. Configuring RIPv2 as the routing protocol.<br>
10. Configuring switchport security or Port-Security on the switches.<br>
11. Host Device Configurations.<br>
12. Test and Verifying Network Communication.<br>
